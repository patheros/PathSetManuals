# Quantum Compass
![Image of QuantumCompass module](../images/QuantumCompass.png)

Quantum Compass is a sequencer where instead of controlling each step, you instead turn on certain notes and it decides when to play each note.

## Quick Start

[Download Quick Start](../examples/QuantumCompass/QuantumCompass_QuickStart.vcvs?raw=true)

1. Connect an external clock to the `Clock or Position` input.
2. Select two or more notes from the keyboard buttons at the bottom of the module.
3. You will see the central ring of LEDs light up showing you sequence generated. 
4. Connect a voice to the `1V/octave` and `Main Gate` outputs.
5. Add more notes or **hold down a note to remove it**.

## Features

### Keyboard 

Unlike normal sequencers the Quantum Compass only takes suggestions on which notes to play. Use 12 `Note` buttons along the bottom to enter which notes you want played. Hold a button down to remove that note.

### Steps 

The `Max Steps Count`, `Steps Attenuverter` and `Steps CV` all control how many steps are in the sequence. Anywhere between 1 and 64 steps are supported. Increasing or decreasing the step count does not change the underlying pattern of notes, it only truncates it.

### Ratchets

Turning up the `Ratchet` knob adds ratcheting to some steps in the sequence. Ratcheted steps can play 2, 3 or 4 times in a single clock cycle. The switches bellow the ratchet know control which of these options are available.  Ratchet also has an attenuverter and CV input. Note that ratcheting pulls from the next 3 notes in the sequence creating more melodic interest. Note that with the `Chaos` knob set to 0 the ratcheting effect is consistent each time the pattern repeats.

### Mutes

Turning up the `Mutes` knob adds silence to some steps in the sequence. The `Mutes` knob also has a attenuverter and CV input. 

### (Auto) Reset

Inside the compass are a `Reset` button and `Reset Trigger` input. Either of these return the sequencer to the start. There are also an `Reset Odds` knob. Turning this up creates a chance that the sequencer will auto reset part way through its sequence. When turning this knob the compass will show a green light on the first step in the sequence and red lights where it has a chance to reset. The `Reset Step` knob controls which steps in the sequence have chance to reset.

### Accidentals & Octaves

The upper left and upper right of the compass have controls and outputs for Accidentals (Flats and Sharps) and Octave Shifts (up or down one octave). These two sections work very similarly. The main `Accidental` or `Octave Shift` knobs can be turned left or right to add steps to the sequence that will have their corresponding effect. As you turn the knob the compass will show you which steps have which effects. If you turn the knobs far in either direction you will get both types of events (Flats and sharps or up and down shifts). Both knobs also have attenuverters and CV inputs. All four events also have output gates at the top. These gates are high the whole clock cycle that they are in effect.

### Chaos

After you've got a fun sequence dialed in you can use the central `Chaos` knob on the Quantum Compass add some randomness to break up the monotony. The compass display will show the effect of the Chaos on whatever other knob you last turned (or you can change the display from the contextual menu). Generally speaking the chaos knob adds more of whatever settings you have dialed in. Though if you turn the chaos knob up too far you'll soon see things become a blur. 

The chaos knob affects Accidentals, Octave Shifts, Ratchets and Mutes. It does not affect the notes entered, the sequence length, or the auto reset.

The `Chaos` knob also has a attenuverter and CV input. Enjoy :)

### Sequence Mode

If all the above wasn't enough, the Quantum Compass has one more twist. Next to the clock input is a switch labeled `Clk` and `Seq` labeled `Position Control`. In the default clock position the clock input expects a trigger/gate and advanced a sequence every time a trigger/gate is received. In the sequence mode that input expects a control voltage. That control voltage directly selects which step the Quantum Compass is playing. When the value changes enough to select a new position a `Gate` is generated. Hook this up to an LFO to create your own or a sample and hold to get even more variation out of the Quantum Compass.

In sequence mode 0V maps to the first step in the sequence and 10Vs maps to the last. Going outside of this range wraps around. So that for example -10V also maps to the last step in the sequence.

## Misc

### Contextual Menu

**Compass Display Mode** - Control what information is displayed on the ring of LEDs. This is updated automatically when you change a knob related to one of the display modes.

**Set Scale** - Quickly set the active notes to a common scale. Each time you do this you will get a random sequence.

**Shift Notes** - Shift all notes in the sequence up or down. Note the keyboard wraps so for example a C note shifted down turns into a B note one ocative higher.

### Bypass
When Quantum Compass is bypassed all outputs stay at 0V.

## Patch Examples

[Download Example 1](../examples/QuantumCompass/QuantumCompass_Example1.vcvs?raw=true)

This example patch uses 5 modules. Left to right: [A clock](https://library.vcvrack.com/ImpromptuModular/Clocked-Clkd), an LFO, Quantum Compass, a [Voice](https://library.vcvrack.com/Bogaudio/Bogaudio-FMOp) and Audio Output.

1. The Clock drives Quantum Compass.
2. The clock also modulates Ratcheting.
3. The LFO modulates Chaos
4. The 1V/Octave and Gate go into the Voice.
5. The Octave Up Gate modulates the sustain on the Voice.
6. The Sharp Gate modulates the feedback
